Introduction to Python

## Setting up your environment

First, determine your version of python (all macs have it pre-installed) by typing into terminal:

```python -V```

You'll likely either have `v2.7` or `3.6`. Use that info to determine which version of [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) you should download. Anaconda simplifies the package installation process for Python modules. 

Part of the Anaconda installation includes [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/), which you can think of as an in-browser Swift Playgrounds. It allows you to quickly interact with Python code that you write by allowing you to execute snippets of code within *cells* in the notebook. 

To launch the Jupyter Notebook process, you can double-click it from the Anaconda application, or you can open it via Terminal with: 


```jupyter notebook```

This will launch your default browser and open a tab. From there you can navigate your files/folders and create Python notebooks.
